## v0.6.0

### Features

- **Highlighting for filter keywords** (#94)
  - The default filter behavior has changed: instead of hiding unmatched items, all items are now displayed, with matches highlighted. This makes it easier to distinguish filtered results without losing context.
  - If you prefer the old behavior (hiding unmatched items), you can enable it by setting `filter.exclude_mode = true`.

- **Filter navigation actions** (#95). In filter mode, you can now quickly jump between matches using the new actions:
  - `filter_next_match` (default key: `n`)
  - `filter_prev_match` (default key: `N`)

- ðŸŽ‰ All items in the [roadmap](https://github.com/fioncat/otree?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap) have been completed!

## v0.5.2

### Features

Add new XML parser!

XML will be parsed in the same way as [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq).

In short:

- If an XML element contains attributes, they will be represented in the tree as String items, with their keys prefixed by `"@"` for distinction.
- If an XML element has attributes, then even if its value is a string, it will be expanded into an object. The element's text value will be stored in a special field called `"#text"`.

For example:

```xml
<outer attr="value">
  <inner>1</inner>
  <inner attr="value">2</inner>
  <inner>3</inner>
</outer>
```

Will be parsed as:

```json
{
  "outer": {
    "inner": [
      "1",
      {
        "@property": "value",
        "#text": "2"
      },
      "3"
    ]
  },
  "@property": "value"
}
```
