## Thanks

I created this tool to better view those super deep YAML files of Kubernetes while [jnv](https://github.com/ynqa/jnv) only supports JSON.

This is based on the amazing TUI framework [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) and its tree widget [tui-tree-widget](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/tui-rs-tree-widget.git).
